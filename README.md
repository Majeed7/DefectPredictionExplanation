# Datasets used for "Game-Theoretic Explanation of Software Defect Predictors: An Exploratory Study"

This repository contains the datasets we used in "Game-Theoretic Explanation of Software Defect Predictors: An Exploratory Study".

In this paper, we investigated the usage of LIME (i.e., Local Interpretability Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (i.e., SHapley Additive exPlanation) in defect prediction.
